			<h2>Tips for maintaining your lawn</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Regular Mowing:</b> Set a regular mowing schedule and stick to it. Mow your grass when it's dry and keep your mower blades sharp to prevent tearing the grass. Adjust the cutting height according to the grass type and the season.</li>
				<li><b>Proper Watering:</b> Water deeply and infrequently rather than shallow and frequently. Aim for 1 to 1.5 inches of water per week, including rainfall. Water early in the morning to minimize evaporation and fungal growth.</li>
				<li><b>Aerate Your Lawn:</b> Lawn aeration allows air, water, and nutrients to penetrate the soil more effectively. Aerate your lawn once a year, typically in the spring or fall, to improve root development.</li>
				<li><b>Fertilize Wisely:</b> Apply fertilizer according to your grass type and local recommendations. Typically, lawns benefit from fertilization in the spring and fall. Avoid over-fertilizing, as it can harm the grass and the environment.</li>
				<li><b>Weed Control:</b> Regularly inspect your lawn for weeds and promptly remove them by hand or use appropriate weed control products. Pre-emergent herbicides can also help prevent weed growth.</li>
				<li><b>Properly Manage Thatch:</b> Thatch is a layer of dead grass and organic matter that can accumulate on the soil's surface. Excessive thatch can hinder water and nutrient absorption. Dethatch your lawn if it becomes too thick.</li>
				<li><b>Lawn Seeding:</b> Over time, grass can thin out. Re-seed your lawn as needed to fill in bare patches and maintain a lush appearance. Spring and early fall are ideal times for seeding.</li>
				<li><b>Edge Your Lawn:</b> Well-defined lawn edges create a clean and manicured look. Use a manual or powered edger to create crisp lines along sidewalks, driveways, and garden beds.</li>
				<li><b>Proper Irrigation:</b> Use a sprinkler system or hose with a sprinkler attachment to ensure even watering across your lawn. Be mindful not to overwater or allow water to puddle.</li>
				<li><b>Pest and Disease Management:</b> Keep an eye out for signs of pests and diseases. Address issues promptly with appropriate treatments to prevent damage to your lawn.</li>
