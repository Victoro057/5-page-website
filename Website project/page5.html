					<li><b>Plant Material: </b>  The cost of the actual plants can vary significantly depending on the type, size, and quantity. Small perennials or annuals may cost as little as $5 to $10 each, while larger trees and shrubs can range from $50 to several hundred dollars each.</li>
					<li><b>Labor Costs: </b> Labor costs for planting services are typically based on the number of plants and the complexity of the project.

			<h2>Tips for maintaining your plants</h2>
			<ul>
				
				<li><b>Water Wisely: </b> Understand the watering needs of your plants. Some require frequent watering, while others prefer to dry out slightly between watering. Water at the base of the plant to avoid wetting the foliage, which can lead to disease.</li>
				<li><b>Mulch: </b> Apply a layer of mulch around the base of your plants. Mulch helps retain moisture, suppress weeds, and maintain an even soil temperature. It also adds a neat and tidy appearance to your garden beds.</li>
				<li><b>Prune Regularly: </b>  Pruning is essential for maintaining the shape and size of your plants. Remove dead or damaged branches, spent flowers, and overgrown or unruly growth to encourage healthy, attractive growth.</li>
				<li><b>Fertilize Appropriately: </b>  Use the right type of fertilizer for your plants and apply it according to the recommended schedule. Over-fertilization can lead to excessive growth and a messy appearance, so follow guidelines carefully.</li>
				<li><b>Weed Control: </b> Keep your garden beds free of weeds. Regularly remove weeds to prevent them from competing with your plants for nutrients and water.</li>
				<li><b>Support Tall Plants: </b>Use stakes, cages, or other supports to keep tall plants like flowers or vegetables from falling over. This helps maintain an orderly appearance and prevents damage.</li>
				<li><b>Deadhead Flowers: </b> Remove spent flowers regularly. Deadheading not only tidies up the plant but also encourages more blooms.</li>
				<li><b>Rotate Containers:</b> If you have potted plants, rotate them occasionally to ensure even growth and sun exposure. This prevents lopsided or leggy growth.</li>
				<li><b>Monitor for Pests and Diseases: </b>  Keep an eye out for signs of pests or diseases. Early detection and treatment are key to maintaining healthy and attractive plants.</li>
				<li><b>Consult Experts: </b>  If you're unsure about plant care or dealing with specific issues, don't hesitate to seek advice from local gardening experts or horticultural professionals.</li>
